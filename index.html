        <div class="flex flex-col">
          <p class="mb-2">
            Joan Duveen, originally trained as a physiotherapist worked in his
            own private acupuncture clinic in the Netherlands until August 2024 after which
            he retired from treating patients. He continues to write and teach.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            Because he was interested in both physical work and philosophy, in
            1975 he heard about Dr. van Buren who taught acupuncture based on
            Chinese philosophy. Since there was a long waiting list for this
            course, he began studying Chinese medicine first with Chinese
            massage and later acupuncture with other teachers. Together with Jan
            van Baarle he wrote a study book:
            <i>Chinese massage for physiotherapists.</i>
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            Graduated from the Dutch Society for Acupuncture, Holland in 1982,
            he finally was able to study with Dr. van Buren in the Netherlands
            and became B.Ac in 1986 at ICOM Holland.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            At the end of this study, he had the rare honour to be invited by
            Dr. van Buren to study with him in the UK for a M.Ac., which he
            finalized in 1991 at ICOM England.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            He became a regular staff member at the International College of
            Oriental Medicine UK for 16 years, teaching Chinese Medicine in year
            3 and 4. During these years, and later till Dr. van Buren died, Joan
            was able to visit him often, to observe his treatments and to learn
            as much as possible and to exchange ideas.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Joan sees it as his task to keep the legacy of the work of Dr. van
          Buren alive, which is the practical use of Chinese philosophy in the
          acupuncture clinic. The core of the work of Dr. van Buren is found in
          the philosophy of the heavenly stems and earthly branches, a subject
          which was theoretical for many years, even in China. Dr. van Buren's
          work was to focus on the practical use of the philosophical ideas of
          the Chinese calendar in the acupuncture clinic.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Since 1987 Joan is an international teacher in this subject which
          brought him, besides the Netherlands to schools and congresses in
          England, Germany, Israel, Norway, Australia, and Poland. Being a
          husband, father, and grandfather, he chose to refuse several requests
          from schools in other countries.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          He is co-founder of the Study centre Pakua (1988). He resigned as
          chairman after 13 years being convinced that the objectives continue
          to be propagated. This study centre still organizes post graduate
          courses in Philosophical Chinese medicine.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          In 1992 he had the chance to travel to China with a group of
          colleagues and Dr. van Buren and his wife and colleague Pauline to
          visit Colleges of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Beijing, Chengdu,
          Hong Kong, and Shanghai. His specialties in the field of acupuncture
          are paediatrics (he studied with Julien Scott), pulse diagnosis
          (studied with Dr. van Buren and Dr. L. Hammer and others), acupuncture
          according to the five elements and the philosophy of stems and
          branches, considering the constitutional energies at birth, based on
          the Chinese calendar.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          He wrote several articles in journals on Chinese medicine on these
          topics and published a book on the theoretical and practical
          principles of treating according to the philosophy of heavenly stems
          and earthly branches. In this book -
          <i>Applying Stems and Branches in Clinical Practice</i> - he shares
          his experience and understanding of this important but historically
          often forgotten approach to acupuncture.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Joan reads widely and continues to study Chinese philosophy and
          Chinese Medicine, especially the Yijing and its practical use in the
          clinic. Since childhood, he has been accustomed to learning through
          spiritual work and staying healthy through fitness, qi gong,
          meditation, long walks and listening to music.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          He is blissed with an active family life with his wife Marjolein, 4
          children and 4 grandchildren.

            Joan Duveen's excellent introduction to the intricate macrocosmic
            background sciences of Chinese medicine is cause for celebration.
            His monograph on the Stems and Branch system of cyclical energy
            calculation makes this once hermetic information approachable by
            enriching it with a lifetime of clinical insights from a senior
            practitioner of acupuncture. I highly recommend this book for every

            Classical acupuncture according to the philosophy of the heavenly
            stems and earthly branches uses the fundamental, cyclical rhythms of
            nature and life as a foundation for health and development. This
            book is one of the first of its kind in the western world to offer a
            practical and scholarly approach to applying this philosophy to
            clinical practice. This handbook guides the practitioner into a
            journey of better understanding of the self and provides the
            theoretical background to be able to confidently diagnose and treat
            patients accordingly. It links and offers invaluable insight into
            the use of Chinese philosophy, psychology and pulse diagnosis.

            Joan Duveen has worked in healthcare since 1972, has practiced
            acupuncture in his private clinic since 1980 and teaches Chinese
            philosophy and acupuncture internationally for almost 40 years. He
            is inspired by his teacher and pioneer in this field Dr. J.D. van
            Buren, who strongly advocated that medicine should be applied
            philosophy. In this spirit Joan received the theoretical and
            practical principles of treating according to the philosophy of
            heavenly stems and earthly branches. In this book Joan shares his
            experience and understanding of this approach.
